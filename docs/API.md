# REST API Reference — FIREWATCH v9.0.0

The API is served by FastAPI. Interactive docs are available at `/docs` unless disabled by deployment policy. When `FIREWATCH_API_KEY` is set, assessment endpoints require `X-API-Key: <key>`.

## Create a scan

`POST /api/v1/scans` (201)

```json
{
  "target_url": "https://authorized.example/",
  "scope_acknowledged": true,
  "profile": "standard",
  "max_pages": 300,
  "max_depth": 8,
  "request_delay_ms": 200,
  "allowed_hosts": [],
  "exclusions": ["/logout", "/delete-account"],
  "request_headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer <test-token>"}
}
```

The `scope_acknowledged` field must be true by default. URLs with credential-like query values are rejected; pass authentication in the encrypted credential fields. Configured authentication material is sent only to the exact hostname and scheme of the root target; on public targets it is sent only over HTTPS. The agent does not forward configured credentials to extra allowed hosts.

| GET | `/api/v1/scans/{id}/bundle` | ZIP of all available reports |
| POST | `/api/v1/scans/{id}/cancel` | Cooperative cancellation request |

## Status model

`queued → running → completed|failed|canceled`. Cancellation is cooperative: an in-flight network request can finish before the next crawler/orchestrator checkpoint. Atomic finalization prevents a cancelled job from being overwritten as completed if cancellation won the state transition.

## Evidence and coverage semantics

Evidence is redacted before it is returned. Nonetheless, reports can disclose application structure and should be access-controlled. `finding_observed` means at least one rule in a catalog family produced a finding; `no_finding_recorded_or_not_applicable` is intentionally not equivalent to “secure.”

## Errors

- `400`: invalid scope, unsupported URL, sensitive query string, or missing scope acknowledgement.
- `401`: missing/incorrect API key when configured.
- `404`: unknown scan or report not ready.
- `409`: operation conflicts with scan state (for example diff before completion).
- `503`: production mode without API key or unavailable service dependency.
